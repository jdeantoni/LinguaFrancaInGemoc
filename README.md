# LinguaFrancaInGemoc

This website contains the formal semantics of [Lingua Franca](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca/)
 defined by using the [MoCCML approach](http://timesquare.inria.fr/moccml/) in the [Gemoc studio](http://eclipse.org/gemoc).

This is still a work in progess but it is already possible to debug LF models like shown in the following screenshot:

It is also possible to do some exhaustive simulation to explore all the state space of a LF program. Resulting state spaces are amenable to model checking in the CADP tool:
